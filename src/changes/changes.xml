                API bug fix (Important, this can break your code without compile errors) : 
                when providing attributes to print jobs, those must be separated
                by '#' instead of ' '. This needed to be changed in order to allow attribute values containing blanks.

                API change - CupsClient provides new operations:

                move job

                Date jobCompleteTime;
                int pagesPrinted;
